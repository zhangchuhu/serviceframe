/// \brief A class for building and executing SQL queries.
///
/// This class is derived from SQLQuery. It adds to that a tie between
/// the query object and a MySQL++
/// \link mysqlpp::Connection Connection \endlink object, so that
/// the query can be sent to the MySQL server we're connected to.
///
/// One does not generally create Query objects directly. Instead, call
/// mysqlpp::Connection::query() to get one tied to that connection.
///
/// There are several ways to build and execute SQL queries with this
/// class.
///
/// The way most like other database libraries is to pass a SQL
/// statement to one of the
/// \link mysqlpp::Query::execute() exec*(), \endlink
/// \link mysqlpp::Query::store() store*(), \endlink or use() methods
/// taking a C or C++ string.  The query is executed immediately, and
/// any results returned.
///
/// For more complicated queries, you can use Query's stream interface.
/// You simply build up a query using the Query instance as you would
/// any other C++ stream object. When the query string is complete, you
/// call the overloaded version of \c exec*(), \c store*() or \c use()
/// that takes no parameters, which executes the built query and returns
/// any results.
///
/// If you are using the library's Specialized SQL Structures feature,
/// Query has several special functions for generating common SQL
/// queries from those structures. For instance, it offers the
/// \link mysqlpp::Query::insert() insert() \endlink method, which
/// builds an INSERT query to add the contents of the SSQLS to the
/// database. As with the stream interface, these methods only build
/// the query string; call one of the parameterless methods mentioned
/// previously to actually execute the query.
///
/// Finally, you can build "template queries". This is something like
/// C's \c printf() function, in that you insert a specially-formatted
/// query string into the object which contains placeholders for data.
/// You call the parse() method to tell the Query object that the query
/// string contains placeholders. Once that's done, you can call any of
/// the many overloaded methods that take a number of SQLStrings (up to
/// 25 by default) or any type that can be converted to SQLString, and
/// those parameters will be inserted into the placeholders. When you
/// call one of the parameterless functions the execute the query, the
/// final query string is assembled and sent to the server.
///
/// See the user manual for more details about these options.

	/// using one of the use() methods instead, which returns the results
	/// one at a time, so they don't allocate as much memory as store().
	///

	/// \c DESCRIBE and \c EXPLAIN queries.  You can use these functions
	/// with other query types, but since they don't return a result
	/// set, exec() and execute() are more efficient.
